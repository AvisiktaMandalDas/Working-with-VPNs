# Working-with-VPNs
This mini-project explores the practical use of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to enhance online privacy and secure internet communication. The objective was to gain hands-on experience with setting up a VPN, understanding how it protects user identity, and evaluating its impact on browsing behavior. For this task, ProtonVPN’s free tier was chosen due to its strong reputation, reliable encryption standards, and transparent no-logs policy. The process began with account creation, followed by installation of the ProtonVPN client on a macOS system. After launching the VPN, a connection was established to a server located in the Netherlands, one of the free server options available.

To confirm that the VPN was functioning correctly, the IP address was checked before and after connecting, using whatismyipaddress.com. A successful IP change confirmed that the VPN was masking the real IP and rerouting traffic through the selected server. Various websites were accessed to test browsing functionality and verify that the connection was encrypted. DNS leak protection was also in place, ensuring that DNS queries did not reveal the original IP address.

After disconnecting the VPN, a noticeable change in speed was observed—browsing became slightly faster, and the IP reverted to the original ISP-provided address. Research was conducted to better understand the encryption technologies used in VPNs, such as OpenVPN and WireGuard, both of which provide strong security using AES-256 encryption. Additional features like kill switch and DNS leak protection were noted as essential components of a privacy-focused VPN.

In conclusion, VPNs are essential tools for anyone concerned about digital privacy. They encrypt internet traffic, hide location, and protect users from surveillance, especially when using public Wi-Fi. However, they are not without drawbacks—free versions often have limited server availability, and speeds can decrease due to encryption overhead. Moreover, some websites may restrict access from known VPN IPs. While VPNs are effective privacy enhancers, they should be used in combination with other security practices for comprehensive protection.
